**POS system** is a python project which I created while in school.
it's not expected to use as a real cash register. I just wanted to share this project with all of you, to show what easy things you all can do and that somebody has inspiration for a new Project. 

**Install**

 1. Install python modules(run setup.py):
	 - colorama
	 - numpy
2. run the POS system file
3. configuration visualized inside the script possible

**Important**

 -  Press the restart button after changing the products
 -  if the setup.py file is not working use this tutorial: [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html)
 - if the file keeps crashing on run, make sure the modules are installed
 - if you have a problem create an "issue report"
